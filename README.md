# Excel Reader (Java & Apache POI)
■ About this program

The current version was written a long while ago. A little attempt/"sandbox"/"playground" for me to explore how to manipulate Excel with the help of Apache POI library for Java.

The goal was to explore the possibility of Excel file management and some automation features to implement for other projects.

## ■ Current Features
The features of the current version are (via Java and Apache POI):
 1. Excel Reading
 2. Excel Writing (including modifying an existing .xlsx file & creating a new .xlsx file)
    - Note: If you have the file set to **READ-ONLY**, it will throw an exception. Please check your file/directory permission in that regard.
    
## ■ What is the purpose of the `attempts` folder?
The `attempts` folder is a little playground for me to explore. If you are reading those files, see if those files could give you some ideas. I doubt that it would even run.

## ■ Other Notes
Once you get the concept, it's pretty easy to do it in C# or other languages as well. C# can also use MSSQL and fetch data from the data warehouse to perform Excel report automation (including using MSSQL to send daily Excel reports through work emails).
