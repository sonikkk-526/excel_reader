# Excel Reader (Java & Apache POI)
■ About this program

A small and simple excel reader and writer using Java and Apache POI.

The current version was written when I was in high school. The goal of this project was to create an easy and user-friendly GUI for excel file management and some sort of automation (and possibly automation of excel file management; currently haven't decided yet).

## ■ Current Features
The features of the current version are:
 1. Excel Reading
 2. Excel Writing (including modifying an existing .xlsx file & creating a new .xlsx file)
    - Note: the above features may trigger your OS security alerts and cause a failure to read/write. Check your OS/target directory permission if failed.
    
## ■ What is the purpose of the `attempts` folder?
The `attempts` folder exists basically because those Java files are under development and will be completed. Currently has no plan as I am also focusing on developing the [other project](https://github.com/sonikkk-526/Lyrics-Editor-for-.LRC). Check that out if you are curious ;D.

## ■ Other Notes
This is the initial release of the Excel Reader (Java & Apache POI) (current version only contains the fundamental feature of this software).
  - It does not contain a graphics user interface (GUI). This program is a command-line interface (CLI) that requires an integrated development environment (IDE).
